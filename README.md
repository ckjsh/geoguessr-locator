# Geoguessr Locator (2022 edition)
Outdated Geoguessr Locator

Unsure if it works on the current geoguessr version but feel free to use it.

## How to use?
Run `node backend.js`, paste *or bookmark* `injection.js` into Chrome's Dev Tools Console Tab, and see the magic. 

## This feels sketchy..?
Feel free to deobfuscate! Really not that hard to deobfuscate the injector.
